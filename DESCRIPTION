Description: The package interfaces the automatic differentiation tool 
  ADOL-C (written in C++) and provides methods to compute derivatives 
  efficiently in using forward mode and reverse (adjoint) mode automatic
  differentiation. The package can be used to compute the gradient, 
  the Jacobian as well the Hessian. Derivatives are useful in the context
  of optimizaton, parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty
  quantification, etc.
